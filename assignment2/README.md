## Required results
Edit this 'README.md' file to report all your results. You only need to update the tables in the reports section by adding screenshots and reporting results.

### Tasks

1) Theory question (1): Save your notes to assignment2/results and link to them from within the report.

2) Theory question (2): Save your notes to assignment2/results and link to them from within the report.

3) Compare your MLS reconstruction results to the surfaces obtained with RIMLS and Screened Poisson Reconstruction, and inspect the differences. Report your findings.
